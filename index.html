<p><i>by The Codes of Death</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Have you ever been in a situation when youâ€™re out and about and you see someone across the room that just takes your breath away? but then you're just too nervous and too afraid to approach the person! Well fear no more because IceBreaker is here to save the day. IceBreak is an exclusive app designed to meet new people and perhaps your future significant other. IceBreak will primarily target events, restaurants, clubs, pubs etc. It will be local in the sense that it can only be used at certain locations. </p>

<p>Our app will allow you to strike up a conversation with anyone you fancy (as long as they're at the same event as you), whether the other person chooses to reciprocate will be entirely their decision - <i>no more fears of being rejected face-to-face with IceBreak being around!</i></p>

<p>P.S one of the rewards could be to get a free drink/shot/prize after a certain number of rejections ;)</p>
