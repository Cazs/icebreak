Well fear no more because IceBreaker is here to save the day. IceBreak is an exclusive app designed to meet new people and perhaps your future significant other. IceBreak will primarily target events, restaurants, clubs, pubs etc. It will be local in the sense that it can only be used at certain locations. \r\n\r\nOur app will allow you to strike up a conversation with anyone you fancy (as long as they're at the same event as you), whether the other person chooses to reciprocate will be entirely their decision - <i>no more fears of being rejected face-to-face with IceBreak being around!</i>\r\n\r\nP.S one of the rewards could be to get a free drink/shot/prize after a certain number of rejections ;)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn the year 2015 team Codes of Death was founded and in the following year, Casper Ndlovu (@Cazs), Tevin Moodley (@tevinmoodley), Aaron Sekati (@ASekati) and Austin Naidoo (@AceAustin17) created IceBreak.",
